                You keep on walking down the path you we're already on. 
                Passing the sitting area, apartment buildings and eventually the little center entirely until street lights stopped passing you by and the path goes dark. 
                Coninuing foward you end up reaching an eerily looking gate at the end of the path. 
                This had to be the grave yard.
