                "You said you knew where you were going.." Deja exashperated. 
                "I did! Or at least I thought I did." She could've sworn the graveyard went down the main path. 
                Deja sighed, "It's ok.." Neveah apologized "Sorry.." 
                She tried to think of another way to go, but couldn't recall where it was for the life of her. 
                They ended up calling it a night and going their seprate ways.
