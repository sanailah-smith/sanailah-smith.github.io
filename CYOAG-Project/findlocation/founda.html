            <p>"I'm surpised you actually knew the path. I got worried for a second." Neveah figured this was Deja's way of saying good job. 
                Giddy she actually managed to remember the way she went out and pushed open the gate, the cold air immediatly disipataing the warmth that pooled in her pockets. 
                Deja's eyes went wide when they went in, taking the scene.
