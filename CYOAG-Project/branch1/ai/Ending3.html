                Neveah just couldn't sooth the anxiety that rushed over her. 
                "Maybe another time, but I just can't tonight." She dejected. 
                She felt bad, but she just couldn't bring herself to do it. Swiftly turning around and rushing away from the path she left Deja behind.
