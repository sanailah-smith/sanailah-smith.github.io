                "I dont know if this is a good idea." Neveahs couldn't help but conjure up why nots in her mind.
                For one it was pretty late, it was almost pitch black outside, save for the street lamps providing some light. 
                Plus her feet were going numb from just how cold it was, her parents where expecting her home, not to mention that Deja was a actual <em>ghost</em>- 
                What if she ended up in a ditch by the end of this? The anxiety felt like it was inate in her veins.  "Please?" Deja pleaded.
            </p>
