            <p class="begining">It was a late night on a winter day, the air cold and frigid. Neveah was on her way home from school. She'd left later than usual, staying back to helping out with some last minute things. The walk back was typical, the snow fall, the footprints trailing behind her, the trees she'd memorized from years of this same path, yet something,,, felt off. She didn't know what it was, but she couldn't shake the feeling like she was being watched.</p>
