                "What the hell was that?!" Whipping her head around she came face to face with a ghostly figure- 
                like she could almost see through them. She couldn't believe what she was seeing. 
                The being..?? looked shocked as well- "you can see me??" they sputtered. 
                Like they couldn't believe their eyes either. "I can't belive that worked..."
