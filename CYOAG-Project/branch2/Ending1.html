                Fear struck her heart and rushed through her bones. 
                She didn't what that was, but she wasn't gonna stick around to find out. 
                With a quick blood curdling shriek she ran away as fast as she could. Too scared to look back, 
                she never found out what exactly- <em>if anything</em> was lurking behind her.
