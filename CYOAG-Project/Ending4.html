                "Thank you," Deja smiled somemly. "I appreciate this more than you know." 
                And with that Deja faded away, sinkig into her grave. It left Neveah with an empty feeling, 
                despite only knowing her for a few hours, it felt as if she'd known her for a lifetime. 
                Making her depature hurt that much more. With the fresh image of the solem look on Deja's face she bent down, 
                sending her off with a few final words of her own trying her best to fight off the tears that threatened to run down her face.
